Hermes bin folder
-----------------

This `bin/` folder contains executables that are useful for development. They
are **NOT INTENDED TO BE DEPLOYED**, but rather are just handy one-offs to
reduce typing while developing. Some of these scripts may be author-specific,
so please feel free to provide patches that make them more general purpose, or
that add your own. In general, all scripts in this folder are 'caveat emptor'.
