Hermes
======

by Erich Blume (blume.erich@gmail.com)

This project contains the code for Hermes, which is a Time Accountant. That is
to say, Hermes is a set of tools for managing time. The scope of Hermes is
quite large, but right now this project primarily provides `hermes`, which is a
python package for manipulating, building, querying, filtering, and tabulating
timespans.
